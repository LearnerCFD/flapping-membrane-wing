The code for the project is contained in .m files in the current directory, and uses MATLAB library folders mapLS, MATLAB/etc, and mesh2d. 
A standalone executable of the code for Windows 32-bit is contained in the flapping_membrane_win directory. 

flapping membrane wing 
------------------------
The main function is test_individual.m, which takes no input and displays a plot of the wing throughtout the calculation, and outputs the final objective mean values of drag, power, and lift. If the calculation fails, the output array equals [1, 1, 1]. 

--------------------------------
flapping_membrane_win directory
1. distrib directory contains the standalone application for windows, and the packaged application for deployment on windows machine without MATLAB.
To run a standalone executable, double click on flapping_membrane_win.exe.
The plots are displayed while the function is running, and the result is displayed to the terminal at the end of the calculation. 
2. src directory contains MATLAB complation files and build log files.
